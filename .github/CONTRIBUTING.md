## Code Style and Formatting

When adding code changes to the project, make sure to follow the existing patterns of style and formatting. Husky is configured to ensure that you do not commit changes that deviate from the pre-configured formatting settings for
- ESLint and Prettier (JavaScript)
- Black (Python)

It might be helpful to configure your code editor with formatting hooks when saving changes so that you do not encounter any surprises once you are ready to commit.

## Submitting Pull Requests

All Pull Requests must follow the template outlined in the [Pull Request Template](./pull_request_template.md). Feel free to add additional sections to the template if necessary. Use Labels to categorize the changes. Add the Pull Request to the appropriate Milestone.

## Opening an Issue

All Issues must follow the template outlined in the [Issue Template](./issue_template.md). As with Pull Requests, feel free to add additional sections to the template if necessary. Use Labels to categorize the issue. Add the Issue to the appropriate Milestone.

## Code Review

In the interest of encouraging good feedback, please be considerate when critiquing changes with a Pull Request. Do not approve changes before testing them. Ask questions directly if something appears incorrect. Consider adding suggestions for sections that can be improved.

## Feature Requests

When adding feature requests, be mindful of the project's established goals. Evaluate how realistic it would be to add the feature, given the scope of the necessary changes and the amount of developers involved in the project. Add the feature request to the appropriate Milestone to help distinguish its priority wtihin the timeline.
